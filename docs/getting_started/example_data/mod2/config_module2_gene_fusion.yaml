# =============== Configuration file for module: Gene Fusion detection =============
# Use this config-file to switch on/off the features that you need for your personal research.
# Furthermore, you can set the detailed parameters for the respective features.


# =============== 1. Module: Gene Fusion Detection - Primary settings =============
module2_gene_fusion_detection_settings:

 # ------- 1.1 Tool Switches --------
  switch_variables:
    run_fusion_detection_with_arriba: True        # Detect gene fusion events with Arriba

  # =============== 1.2 Output directories =============
  # The output directories for the respective tool-outputs are defined here.
  # This is important for importing the outputs into the GUI
  output_directories:
    arriba_output_dir: "arriba"


  # =============== 2. Required settings & input files for selected functionalities =============
  # =============== 2.1 BAM files =============
  # ATTENTION: Use absolute paths when defining input file paths!!!

  # Directory, where the alignment results are stored
  # Choices:
  #   1. star               - Uses the STAR-alignment results
  #   2. directory-URI      - Searches the given directory for BAM-files
  # Expects for every sample to have a subdirectory with the same name as the sample name (see following example)!
  # E.g. dir: "output/star" -> expects as input: "output/star/{sample}/{sample}.sorted.bam"
  input_dir_of_bam_files:
    "star"

  # Attributes of aligned files (input BAM files)
  bam_files_attributes:
    # Reference genome build that was used to create the input BAM files
    reference_genome_build:
      "GRCh38_chr21"          # "GRCh37" or "GRCh38" or "GRCh38_chr21" (for testing purposes)

    filename_extension: # File extension of the input BAM files
      ".sorted.bam"
      
    sorted:
      "position"      # Either position (for position-sorted) or name (for name-sorted)


  # 2.1 Arriba: Detect gene fusion events with Arriba
  arriba_settings:
    # Optional settings for arriba (see here: https://arriba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command-line-options/)

    # Strongly recommended: Optional blacklist file for arriba (see here: https://arriba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/input-files/#blacklist)

      # ATTENTION: Choose blacklist file that fits to chosen reference genome!
